# Celestial-Bodies-DB

Using psql, I created 5 tables (galaxy, planet, moon, star, mythology) to get a better understanding of how this language works. 

Creating the tables, columns and inserting the data was the easy part. 

Understanding how to navigate was what took awhile to do (especially with how slow the command line took to register my key...often resulting in errors in lines)

Remember: If you make a mistake in your command line, (\r) will save your life.
